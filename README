*To Do
- Make sure tas_slp_anom_MJJAS works

OVERVIEW

---------------------------------------------
STEP-BY-STEP DIRECTIONS
1. Running the dynamical adjustment (L0 code)
a) After cloning repository, add /jobs, /out, and /logs folders to /scriptrunner. 

b) The first file you will need to run is scriptrunner/L0_scriptrunner_tas_slp_anom_MJJAS_creator.py. This will run py/L0/tas_slp_anom_MJJAS_creator.py for each region and save tas and slp anomalies for each region for May, June, July, August and September. These are currently set up to save to a scratch folder.

c) Next, distance matrices need to be saved for the dynamical adjustment. This can be done by running L0_scriptrunner_distance_matrix.py and L0_scriptrunner_distance_index.py.

d) The dynamical adjustment for May, June, July, and August can now be performed by running L0_scriptrunner_dyn_adj.py. It will save both the dynamical predictions and the RMSE.

2. Converting the output to a form that can be plotted (L1 code)
